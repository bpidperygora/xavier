## What was done: 

- Add bank archives, 
- Add bank single page, 
- connect all lib's, 
- Add widget Currency Course. 
- Connect API to make widget work) 
- Add options to show history and update currency pair from JS API.

## What was not done: 
- Gallery on bank page ( 10 min to do )
- The parsing ID ( i think we can use post - > ID 5 min to do)
- Revise entries by cron job.
- On the front it should be possible to search ( some time to do but i know how =) )
